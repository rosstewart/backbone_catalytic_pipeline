# Backbone Catalytic Pipeline
Pipeline to predict catalytic residues of a protein from N, CA, and C atom coordinates only (no residue or other atom information)

To run: `python ncac_cat_pipeline.py <input.pdb> <output.npy>`

An example .pdb file and output predictions are located at `pdb_test.pdb` and `pdb_test_preds.npy`, respectively
